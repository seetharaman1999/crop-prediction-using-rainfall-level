# Rainfall Classification Model With Suitable Crop Prediction Using CNN

In this project we tried to predict the rainfall using 3 different model
- Linear regression
- SVR
- CNN

Based on the absolute mean error we found out the efficient model, using that model we predicted the crops which are suitable for that particular state in that particular year.
